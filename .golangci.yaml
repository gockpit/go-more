    - dupword # Checks for duplicate words in the source code.
    - durationcheck # Check for two durations multiplied together.

    - gocyclo # Computes and checks the cyclomatic complexity of functions.
    - gofmt # Gofmt checks whether code was gofmt-ed. By default this tool runs with -s option to check for code simplification.
    - goimports # Check import statements are formatted according to the 'goimport' command. Reformat imports in autofix mode.
    - gosec # Inspects source code for security problems.
    - gosimple # Linter for Go source code that specializes in simplifying code.
